Python Challenge
For this challenge, we were tasked with two things. The first was to take financial information and write a program using python to find several things. We were tasked in finding the total amount of months in the data set, the net amount of Profit/Losses, the changes in Profit/Losses over time, the greatest increase in profit, and the greatest decrease in profit. With the greatest increase and decrease, we also needed to state the amount and the date. The second task of this challenge was to take election data and find several things. This included the total number of votes cast, the percentage of votes on each candidate, the total number of votes each candiate one, and the winnder based on the popular vote. For both of these tasks, we needed to read in the csv files and then produce the output file in the form of a text file.
